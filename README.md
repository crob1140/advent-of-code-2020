# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions to the questions in the Advent of Code 2020. For my own practice, I have written all of these solutions in Haskell.

If you have GHC installed, you can run any of these scripts by navigating to the directory and running:
```
ghc -o main main.hs
./main
```
If you *don't* have GHC installed, you can copy and paste the contents of a file into an online compiler such as the one at [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/haskell).
